## Mission Statement

The purpose of this project is to build, from the ground up, an operating inventory system for managing on-site stock at a retail establishment. Upon completion, users accessing the application will be able to control their supply in an easy-to-use format with immediate results.  

## Functionality

### Create 

Users will be able to add new models as they arrive on-site, providing information to keep everyone on the same page.

### Read

Any user wanting to view inventory will be able to pull up real time results for a better understanding of what equipment is currently in-house. 

### Update 

When products are added, removed, or sold, users will be able to change the name or number of a particular item to accurately reflect availability at all times. 

### Destroy 

Removing old models when they run too low on stock, get pulled off of display, or get discontinued.
